              <p align="left">"<span style="color:brown;">Once upon a time, there was a Vivek Bhookya. This
                 Vivek Bhookya was laying on his bed wondering what gift he should
                  give his girlfriend for her birthday.Â Vivek closed his eyes to
                   focus on his thoughts.</span>"
              </p>
              <p align="left">"<span style="color:brown;">Out of nowhere appeared a baby-blue website, a website
                 that held stories and pictures and memories from the relationship
                  Vivek and Surabhi had been building. The website would be covered
                   in pictures, one section of the website devoted to stories and
                    another section designed to be a gallery. Vivek saw himself
                     exploring the website in his mind, noting the appearance and
                      experience presented.Â 
                      <br>Suddenly...Vivek fell asleep, because he was on his bed
                       and his eyes were closed...</span>"
              <p>
              <p align="left">---</p>
              <p align="left">I was going through the files on my computer and I
                 found a set of htmlÂ files for this book I downloaded. Confused
                  about why the book included these files, I opened the files
                   -- each file was a different chapter from the book,
                    presented as a simple website.
              </p>
              <p align="left">Having some knowledge of html, I started messing
                 around with the files for fun. I then realized that the dream
                  I had of the website didn't have to stay a dream for much
                   longer.
              </p>
              <p align="left">The usual hours of coding and Google searches
                 later, on my computer sat what I had dreamed. Exactly as I
                  envisioned the website...nothing less than I saw, the features
                   I imagined were implemented on par, and every element's
                    position reflected their corresponding locations
                     from my vision.
              </p>
              <p align="left">Surabhi was overjoyed when she saw the website ðŸ˜Š and
                 I was very happy with how much she liked it.
              </p>
              <p align="left">The success of dearbeloved.me only encouraged me
                 to create my website, mrvivacio.us:
               </p>
              <p align="left">It is a similar story -- I saw the idea for the
                 site in my head then later implemented it -- but how I felt
                  when I saw my finished product was no less than when I
                   fulfill any of my dreams. If it can be imagined, it can be
                    built. I have only found inspiration as I continue to build
                     more and more, albeit with plenty of frustration
                      (opportunities to overcome adversity) along the way as
                       well ðŸ˜… !
              </p>
              <p align="left">Building simple websites is quite cute and not as
                 difficult as other projects, but in terms of professional
                  interests, I would prefer to do software development away
                   from web development, such as mobile or Alexa, for example.
              </p>
              <p align="left">---</p>
              <p align="left">Bringing dearbeloved.me and mrvivacio.us to reality was really really really fun.
                <br>But, I am not a web developer. I just like building things.
