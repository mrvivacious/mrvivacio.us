              <p align="left">"<span style="color:brown;">Once upon a time, a nervous student sat down for lunch
                 with his/her lunchbox. As s/he opened the lunchbox, s/he found a piece of paper
                  inside on top of the food. The paper said, 'Good luck on your exam!' The student
                   began to feel much better about the exam and thanked his/her parents for the sweet note.</span>"
              </p>
              <p align="left">When I first read this story, I thought, "<span style="color:brown;">Wow, that's so
                 sweet! I can imagine feeling wonderful after finding a surprise note like that, even more so right before an exam!</span>"
              </p>
              <p align="left">I don't receive notes like these very often and I
                felt that writing my own notes wouldn't be as effective in terms
                 of the emotional delivery when I opened my "surprise" notes.
                 <br>
                 People would benefit with more words of encouragement and
                 positive messages in their lives, especially during critical
                 times (before an exam, meeting, interview...etc).
              </p>
              <p align="left">Something that can automatically send positive
                messages to you and your loved ones out of the blue...that is
                what inspired Magical Messages, my first "code" project.
              </p>
              <p align="left">---
              </p>
              <p align="left">First, I started with a <a href="https://www.raywenderlich.com/154676/android-studio-tutorial-introduction">tutorial</a>. The end product
                 of the tutorial was similar to what I had in mind for Magical
                  Messages -- when you're starting something new, using a tutorial
                   that produces something close to your desired finished product is very, very helpful.
              </p>
              <p align="left">I finished the tutorial, resulting in a "Magic 8 ball" type app. Great! Now, the fun begins.
              </p>
              <p align="left">The most important thing -- obviously, the colors. Beige, black, and blue, much better than before. Cleeeeaaaaaaaaaan.
              </p>
              <p align="left">Get rid of the 8 ball messages and replace them with my personal words, lessons, and messages. Done.
              </p>
              <p align="left">Add a share button that lets users share the messages
                 with their contacts. Ok, that didn't work. This also didn't work.
                  Oh! I'll try this...I tried it.
                  <br>Ah,
                  <br>Got it.
              </p>
              <p align="left">Let's test it. Gotta send a message to my parents
                 first so they know I'm putting my knowledge to good use.
                 <br>Woah,
                 <br>It
                 <br>Sent.
              </p>
              <p align="left"><br><br><br>Woah.<br><br><br>
              </p>
              <p align="left">I have in my palm an app. An app that I just built.
                 An app that adds positivity to this world. 
              </p>
              <p align="left">"<span style="color:brown;">This is what I was supposed to do.</span>"
              </p>
              <p align="left">One idea, a tutorial, lots of Google, many failures,
                 not giving up, and nine hours later, Vivek Bhookya presents:
                 <br>Magical Messages, the premier, highly-scalable (<b><i>cough</i></b>), homemade Android app!
              </p>

              </p>
              <p align="left">Amazon Echo is a device that speaks to you.
                Reading positive texts is great, but hearing positivity takes it up several notches.
              </p>
              <p align="left">Creating the Alexa skill wasn't as difficult as
                 creating the Android app. The hardest part was starting the project, however.
              </p>
              <p align="left">There were very little tutorials and code samples
                 to follow from and it was quite difficult to understand what
                  exactly the code was doing and how it worked -- but, what isn't
                   confusing at the first experience?
              </p>
              <p align="left">I found a tutorial that reads out facts, rotated
                 them for my premier, highly-coveted, deluxe suite of positive messages, and, 
              </p>
              <p align="left">"<span style="color:brown;">Alexa, magical messages.</span>"
              </p>
              <p align="left">---
              </p>
              <p align="left">Perfect. What else can I do?
              </p>
              <p align="left">---
              </p>
              <p align="left">The dreams we have are wonderful. Imagining them
                 coming true brings such ecstasy to us, but some of them are
                  difficult. Some of them seem impossible. Some of them, we are
                   too afraid to even try.
              </p>
              <p align="left">After seeing what I envisioned in my head in my
                 palm, I realized that anything imaginable is possible, at least
                  in terms of software. We all must dream big, and pursue them
                   with efforts greater than ever before. A n y t h i n g you
                    visualize can be what you see in your true visuals...I stand
                     by this statement after having brought several ideas of
                      mine to life with much more to come.
              </p>
              <p align="left">Everyone might not like to code, but anyone can.
                 If you have an idea that requires any software, you should do
                  it, even if you don't know how. You will fail for sure and run
                   into many "impossible" problems -- did you think it would be
                    easy to accomplish the marvelous dreams that fill your wonderful
                     mind? 
                     <br>They aren't supposed to be easy. Let your vision drive
                      you through the finish line. Imagine how good you'll feel
                       knowing that you contributed something permanent to the
                        world, something that can make the world a better place forever after now. 
              </p>
              <p align="left">Now, get to a point where you don't have to imagine anymore.
