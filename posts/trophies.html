              <p align="left">If you publish a skill (app) for the Amazon
                Alexa, you can receive a hoodie/shirt/pair of socks/etc as a
                reward from Amazon. Should your skill be used by 100 or more
                unique users, you will earn an Echo Dot device on top of the
                aforementioned reward,

              </p>
              <p align="left">After succeeding with Magical Messages, I realized
                 that Alexa doesn't really do much.<br>But we can make it do much.
              </p>
              <p align="left">Magical Messages was and is really fun to use for me but
                 I didn't want to limit my working knowledge to "one response" skills.
                  The ideas I had were much more complicated and as a result, I need to learn more.
              </p>
              <p align="left">There are wonderful tutorials online that compensate
                 for -- at the time of writing -- the lack of documentation provided by Amazon <i> in spades</i>.
                  Tutorials are super when attempting to learn new skills (both general skills and Alexa skills).
              </p>
              <p align="left">---
              </p>
              <p align="left">Come Thanksgiving break, I wanted to write a new skill
                 that can do more than Magical Messages. My goal at the time was to create a skill that responds
                 to the user based on a user-specified piece of information. Instead
                  of a "start-Alexa responds-end" dialogue, it would now be a
                   "start-Alexa asks-user selects-Alexa responds accordingly-end" operation.
              </p>
              <p align="left">Come Holiday Facts, a skill that provides facts for
                 a handful of your favorite holidays ðŸ˜® !
              </p>
              <p align="left">Being able to hear Alexa respond appropriately to different
                 queries felt incredible -- the experience felt close to a real conversation,
                  albeit a short conversation!
              </p>
              <p align="left">Accomplishing this project only lead to ideas of more intricate
                 projects, projects that will engage the user more than before and will
                  feel more and more like a real conversation.
              </p>
              <p align="left">The goal? When people use my projects, they
                 should feel more of,<br>
                "<span style="color:brown">A friend that I can't see but can
                   definitely speak to and feel connected with,</span>"<br>
                and less of,<br>
                 "<span style="color:brown">Wow! This toy can talk
                    like a human! What a weird piece of technology!</span>"
              </p>
              <p align="left">---
              </p>
              <p align="left">I submitted my skill and received a coooooool hoodie
                 in the mail two months later! Not long after that, at my doorstep
                  sat a tiny white Echo Dot.
              </p>
              <p align="left">The hoodie and Dot are special to me. To me, they are the
                 physical manifestations of both me pursuing my efforts and the
                  process of my vision
                  becoming reality. <br>In the eyes of Amazon,<br>These are probably just
                   handouts for helping popularize the Alexa marketplace.
              </p>
              <p align="left">But to<br>Me,<br>These<br>Are

              <p align="left">Trophies.
              </p>
              <br><br>
              <p align="left">It isn't about the hoodie or the Dot, though. These things
                 are fun, but they aren't the <i>why</i> I created the experience
                  written above. For me,<br>
                 I do what I do for the experiences, experiences that remind me of
                  where I started and how far I've come. I do what I do for the
                  knowledge I'll gain, knowledge to help bring myself even further.<br>
                  I do what I do because it's what I'm supposed to do.
